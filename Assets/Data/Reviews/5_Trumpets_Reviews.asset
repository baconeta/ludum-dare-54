    appropriateHi: Doctor Elefunk in his element is a sight to behold!
    appropriateLo: The show sucked but it definitely wasn't Elefunk's fault, I swear!
    inappropriateHi: Harmon E's meltdown at the sound of trumpets did nothing to
      mar the essence of Belle's masterpiece.
    inappropriateLo: Painful as it was to sit through, Harmon E throwing a fit every
      time the trumpet sounded was at least entertaining.
    mixedHi: As scared as Harmon E seemed of Elefunk, the two put on a scintillating
      night of music!
    mixedLo: What a let down. All Harmon E's fault, definitely not Elefunk's, he
      was great!
    neither: Uninspiring roster of musicians. They all just seemed to be going through
      the motions.

    perfectVariation: There were trumpets, it was sunset, what more can I say about
      perfection?
    averageVariation: Not too remarkable, not too shabby, the instruments just about
      got the job done.
    terribleVariation: Tonight's rendition of <i>Trumpets at Sunset</i> sounded <b>so</b>
      wrong it might as well be called <i>Mridangams at Noon</i>.
  affinityFeedback:
    perfectVariation: Anyone can play the right notes, but tonight, these people
      made their instruments <i>sing</i>.
    averageVariation: Perfectly acceptable at a bar show, but a professional orchestra
      needs to step up their game.
    terribleVariation: Not much can ruin a sunset, but this performance managed it
      somehow.
