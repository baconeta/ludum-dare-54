    appropriateHi: Key-Wi might not be able to fly, but he definitely made my heart
      soar!
    appropriateLo: Key-Wi's charm still wasn't enough to salvage a soulless rendition.
    inappropriateHi: Brava, despite the disrespectful choice to cast Warwolf, the
      keyboard warrior.
    inappropriateLo: How incredibly insensitive! To let Warwolf, a keyboard warrior,
      sully Argo's opus.
    mixedHi: Key-Wi and Warwolf were at each other's throats all night, yet it somehow
      made it all more electrifying, despite the disrespect.
    mixedLo: Even Key-Wi's presence could not make up for the insult of allowing
      a keyboard warrior like Warwolf to take the stage for this song.
    neither: The cast of musicians was nothing to write home about.
  instrumentChoiceFeedback:
    perfectVariation: The xylophone and the organ melding with the gentle percussion
      really brings out the magic in the <i>Harmony</i>.
    averageVariation: Sure, yeah, most of the instruments sounded right for <i>Harmony</i>,
      what more can I say?
    terribleVariation: I am almost certain that no one involved in this production
      knew a single thing about the instruments used in <i>Flightless Harmony</i>.
  affinityFeedback:
    perfectVariation: The performers were all in the zone, and the result was spectacular
      in the true sense of the word.
    averageVariation: There was not a lot <i>wrong</i>, per se, I just expected more
      from professional musicians.
    terribleVariation: The harmony turned flightless only because the performances
      were so soulless.
