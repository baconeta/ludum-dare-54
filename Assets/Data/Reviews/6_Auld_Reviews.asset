    appropriateHi: Scot, in his natural musical habitat, easily bags performer of
      the night!
    appropriateLo: A good show from Callum's former pupil, but I fear it may have
      been in vain.
    inappropriateHi: I have to say, I was a little unsure of Bonnie "Bubblegum" Bop,
      but the show came together quite well in the end.
    inappropriateLo: Bonnie Bop has bubble gum in her mouth. Who thought it was a
      good idea to cast her for this Scottish mouth melody?
    mixedHi: Scot pulls a resounding win from under the damper that Bonnie Bop could
      have otherwise put on tonight's show!
    mixedLo: A man expelled from the composer's school, and a teen with a grudge
      against it. What could possibly go wrong?
    neither: Not a single standout player in the entire lineup. Disappointing.
  instrumentChoiceFeedback:
    perfectVariation: Wallace will be happy to know that his preferences are being
      respected when conductors arrange his music.
    averageVariation: Certainly not up to Wallace's exacting standards of instrument
      choice, but functional, I suppose.
    terribleVariation: Wallace distanced himself from his school when they deviated
      from his preferences. I wonder what would he say about this show.
  affinityFeedback:
    perfectVariation: That's the advantage with the classics. Your performers have
      so much practice that it sounds pitch-perfect.
    averageVariation: Decent effort from the performers, but ultimately falling short
      of real greatness.
    terribleVariation: For such a familiar tune, you'd think professional musicians
      would be able to play it better than some gorillas with banjos.
