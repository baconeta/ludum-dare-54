    appropriateHi: Harmon E with her free spirit was an inspired choice for this
      show!
    appropriateLo: Even Harmon E's charm and obvious love for the piece was not enough
      to put this one over the finish line.
    inappropriateHi: A punk rock drummer in a peaceful song like <i>Maracan Nights</i>
      was a puzzling choice, but hey, if it works!
    inappropriateLo: Viperpunk's vibe doesn't exactly scream "hippie energy," does
      it? But she screams though. A lot.
    mixedHi: Harmon E and Viperpunk are an unusual pair, especially for <i>Maracan
      Nights</i>, but what can I say. They killed it!
    mixedLo: Viperpunk and Harmon E togther were like oil on water. Not really mixing
      together but still capable of starting a dumpster fire.
    neither: I generally like to see musicians who are more invested in the piece
      they're playing, but that's just me.

    perfectVariation: The perfect instruments on this track had me screaming "Hip,
      hippie, hooray!"
    averageVariation: <i>Maracan Nights</i> is famous for its eclectic mix of instruments,
      but the show could have tried to be a little truer to its roots.
    terribleVariation: What was the conductor thinking? Surely anyone could have
      put together a better arangement of instruments.
  affinityFeedback:
    perfectVariation: These skilled musicians and their sublime rendition of <i>Maracan
      Nights</i> will stay with me for many nights to come.
    averageVariation: This defintely was one of the performances of all time. No
      two ways about it.
    terribleVariation: You could have pulled some hippies off the street and they
      would play this song better.
