    appropriateHi: When Viperpunk gets in the groove, she becomes an unstoppable
      force of rock!
    appropriateLo: Viperpunk struggles against an unimpressive ensemble to make her
      hero proud.
    inappropriateHi: Clef's hat notwithstanding, it was a solid showing for the <i>Ballad
      of Beats</i>.
    inappropriateLo: Not only was the rendition terrible, they had to add insult
      to injury with Clef's hat laughing in Krypton's face.
    mixedHi: Clef's hat was distracting in a DJ Krypton song, but it was easy to
      overlook when Viperpunk was on <i>fire</i>.
    mixedLo: I really hoped Viperpunk could remedy the callous inclusion of Clef
      and his hat, but it was just wishful thinking.
    neither: None of the performers seemed to have any kind of connection with the
      piece.

    perfectVariation: Beat for beat, the instruments used in <i>Ballad</i> proved
      to be just the right ones!
    averageVariation: The instrument selection was just shy of perfect, which ever
      so slightly dampened the magic.
    terribleVariation: Beat for beat, the instruments used in <i>Ballad</i> proved
      to be <b>exactly</b> the wrong ones.
  affinityFeedback:
    perfectVariation: Boy, did every single muscian know how to tickle their instrument
      just right!
    averageVariation: Tonight was a good reminder that even performers of this calibre
      aren't always flawless at everything!
    terribleVariation: Challenges aren't always met, but the extent to which these
      players fumbled this one would embarrass the King of Drums.
