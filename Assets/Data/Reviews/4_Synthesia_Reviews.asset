    appropriateHi: Maverick sheds his lazy persona and shines as be brings his uncle's
      piece to life!
    appropriateLo: Strum was the right choice to play his uncle's <i>Moderna</i>,
      but it didn't quite come together.
    inappropriateHi: Even Scot Baggins of the Bagpipe Academy couldn't ruin the brilliance
      of <i>Synthesia</i>.
    inappropriateLo: Scot Baggins's very presence at the show rubs salt in the wound
      of a terrible showing of <i>Synthesia</i>.
    mixedHi: Maverick more than makes up for the brazen addition of foulmouthed bagpiper
      Scot Baggins as the show sizzles in splendour!
    mixedLo: The shadow of Oslo's humiliation at the hands of Scot Baggins loomed
      so large that not even Maverick could outshine it.
    neither: Anyone can play the right notes, what you need is some oomph. Which
      no one had.
  instrumentChoiceFeedback:
    perfectVariation: Oslo can rest easy knowing that conductors know exactly which
      instruments to use to capture his unique sound.
    averageVariation: With electronic music, there are so many instruments to choose
      from that sometimes it's easy to make small wrong choices.
    terribleVariation: Composers pick out instruments for their track very carefully.
      It's nice that conductors don't have the same burden, right? Right?
  affinityFeedback:
    perfectVariation: When it's obvious that the players know their instruments inside
      out, the result is simply mesmerising.
    averageVariation: '"Functional". "Servicable". "Middling". These are all words
      you could use to describe tonight''s performance.'
    terribleVariation: Oslo believed anybody could perform well as a musician. Thank
      God he isn't around to have witnessed this catastrophe.
