  bio: Key-Wi was born in the middle of a performance. Both his parents are musicians
    and their band did not offer maternity leave. Getting his beak stuck in a guitar
    moments after birth left him deeply scarred, but over time, he learned to tap
    his beak against the keys of simple instruments. That's how he got his name.
    Absolutely no other reason.
  funFact: Key-Wi received the first ever diagnosis of Post Traumatic String Disorder.
