  bio: Not quite living up to his name, Warwolf only wages wars on the internet,
    typing away furiously, which incidentally made him better at his instrument of
    choice. Turns out, it's really hard to play most musical instruments when you
    have claws. Also, Warwolf is not his real name, and he prefers to remain anonymous.
  funFact: Warwolf dislikes being misidentified as a troll, and campaigns online
    to raise awareness.
