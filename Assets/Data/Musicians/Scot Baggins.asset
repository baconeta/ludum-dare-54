  bio: Scot Baggins was born at the age of 7, and trained as a professional swimmer
    for several years. It wasn't until he won the Lung Capacity Award at his local
    college/supermarket that he turned to music. Consequently, he can play wind instruments
    until the audience get breathless, but not much else.
  funFact: Scot was expelled from Broomhill Bagpipe Academy for insulting visiting
    musicians.
