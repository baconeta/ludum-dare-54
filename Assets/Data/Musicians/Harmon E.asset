  bio: True to their 'free-spirited' nature, Harmon E's parents took her to a pachyderm
    camp when she was young, where she spent two weeks in abject terror of the pachyderm
    animal family, and developed a deep-seated fear of the sound of trumpets. But
    she eventually got in touch with her own free spirit, learning to play reeds
    and rhythmic percussion.
  funFact: Harmon E is named for her grandfather who died fighting for peace when
    no wars were on.
