  bio: His parents wanted him to go into cooking, but a typo at the population registry
    left him with an unfortunate name and a love for music. Born with serious commitment
    issues, Clef could never bring himself to specialise. So when asked, "Which instrument
    do you want to play?" he replied, "Yes."
  funFact: He did not in fact become a chef, but his first instrument was a jar of
    mayonnaise.
