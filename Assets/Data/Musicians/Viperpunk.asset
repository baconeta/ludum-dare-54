  bio: Viperpunk's first ever mosh pit was when she was still inside her mother's
    womb. There was no other way she could have turned out. Her dream is to become
    the best drummer the world has ever seen, but when she wants to, girl can <i>shred</i>.
  funFact: From a young age, she was drawn to music like a goth to a flame.
