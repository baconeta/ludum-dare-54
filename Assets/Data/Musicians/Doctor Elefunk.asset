  bio: Born of a musical experiment gone wrong, it is unclear whether Elefunk is
    a scientist that turned into an elephant or an elephant that turned into a scientist.
    Attached to his body is what he considers to be the best instrument. Or at least
    the only one worth playing. Elefunk's hobbies include long walks on the beach
    and watching sunsets.
  funFact: Four critics that have been harsh on Elefunk's performances have mysteriously
    vanished.
