  bio: Richard Winstrum, known professionally as Maverick Strum, has never been impressed
    by anything in his life. The closest he's ever come was with his late uncle,
    a legendary composer, who taught and cultivated Maverick's interest in music.
    While he's usually too lazy to play more than four strings, he is a brilliant
    performer when he makes the effort.
  funFact: True to his name, Maverick thinks classical music (and instruments) are
    for snobs.
