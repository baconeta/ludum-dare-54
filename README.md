###
Welcome to Setting the Stage!

Are you ready to put on the performance of a lifetime?

Consider the story of each night's composition carefully.

Arrange the right musicians and the right instruments in the limited space on the stage.

Remember, not all your musicians are skilled with all your instruments!

Your performance will be reviewed by critics on three fronts:
- How well you respect the piece's history & composer
- Whether you used the right instruments for the piece
- The skill of your musicians with the instrument you assigned them

It's your job to figure out the right arrangements for your performances.

Happy conducting!
